                            <br/>
                            50 years on from our momentous 1970/71 league and FA Cup double, weâ€™re proud to present a new away kit inspired by the strip worn by our heroes.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The new kit will be worn for the first time by Arsenal Women in their Vitality Women's FA Cup tie against Crystal Palace on Sunday, May 16. 
                            The menâ€™s team will also wear the new kit in their final away fixture of the season â€“ also against Crystal Palace â€“ on Wednesday, May 19.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The new kit is available to buy exclusively until May 20 at Arsenal Direct, our flagship Armoury store and official adidas stores.
