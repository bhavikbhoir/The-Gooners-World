                            The big news that came ahead of our derby clash was that Club Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was dropped to the bench for disciplinary issues.

                            <br/>
                            Sources say that this decision was taken after the captain reported late when squad met up earlier today. Believed not to be the first time & falls out of line with clubâ€™s matchday protocols.
