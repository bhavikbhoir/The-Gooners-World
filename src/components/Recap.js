                                        The Gunners finished 8th in the Premier league with 61 points (18W 7D 13D) scoring joint third most number of goals (68) with Lacazette finishing 
                                        as our top scorer in the PL with 13 goals.

                                        Arsenal's excellent run in Europe came to end at the hands of Villarreal after the semi-final tie ended 1-1 on aggegrate with the Spanish side going ahead on away goals.

                                        Our domestic cup runs weren't upto to the mark this season as the Holders went out against Southampton after losing 1-0 in the FA Cup 4th round. We however managed to 
                                        reach the Quater finals of the EFL Cup but were outdone by the League Champions Manchester City in a 4-1 loss to the Gunners.

                                        <br/>
                                        European spot looked achievable until the last few minutes of the season but the results elsewhere didn't go in our favor and the Gunners will be playing their first season
                                        outside of Europe since 95/96.
