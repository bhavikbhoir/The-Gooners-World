                            Late goals from Gabriel Martinelli and Nicolas Pepe meant we took all three points home and kept the fight for Europa League spot alive.

                            The final away game of the season saw the men's team don the newly released away kit.

                            Pepe had given us the lead in the first half with a lovely finish at the end of a slick team move, before Christian Benteke equalised.

                            Just as it appeared we would be held to a frustrating draw, Martinelli popped up in the 91st minute to put us back in front, and Pepe sealed the win late on with a fine individual effort.
