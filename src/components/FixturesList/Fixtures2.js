                            We delivered a commanding performance to come from a goal down to win on the road at Leicester City on Sunday.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            After conceding early on when Youri Tielemans raced through to score, we kept our composure and worked our way back into the game when David Luiz headed home a well-worked free kick.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> 
                            Alex Lacazette put us in the lead from the spot after we were awarded a penalty for handball on the stroke of half time, before the lively Nicolas Pepe wrapped up the scoring after the interval at the end of a flowing counter attack.
