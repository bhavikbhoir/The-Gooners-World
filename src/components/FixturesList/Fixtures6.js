                            Alexandre Lacazette claimed his 50th Premier League goal as we returned to winning ways in convincing fashion at Bramall Lane.

                            <br/>
                            The Frenchman opened the scoring with his 49th in the competition - applying the finishing touch to a wonderful team move - before sealing the win late on with goal number 50, tucking home Thomas Partey's excellent throughball.

                            <br/> 
                            In between those two goals, Gabriel Martinelli scored his first for 15 months, after good work from Nicolas Pepe.

                            There was a welcome clean sheet as well, as we prepared for Thursday's must-win encounter in Prague in the perfect manner.
