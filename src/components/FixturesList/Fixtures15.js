                            A fifth straight win to close out the Premier League season was not enough to secure European football next term.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            A second successive brace from Nicolas gave us all three points on the final day of the season, but results elsewhere didn't go our way, meaning we finished eighth for the second year in a row.

                            <br/> 
                            With Tottenham and Everton both trailing in their games, we were on course for seventh place, and European football again.

                            <br/>                         
                            However, late Tottenham goals dampened the stadium atmosphere and our final day win wasn't enough to secure a spot in the European Conference league.

                            We finish eighth in the Premier League, the same placing as last season (but with five more points), and it means we will not be competing in European football next term, for the first time since 1995/96.
