                            We mounted a superb comeback from three goals down to claim a point in a thrilling encounter with West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The hosts took complete control of the game in the opening half-hour, scoring through Jesse Lingard, Jarrod Bowen and Tomas Soucek.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> 
                            But a Soucek own goal before the interval gave us hope, and then another own goal, this time by Craig Dawson, and an Alex Lacazette header sealed an unlikely point.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>                         
                            The comeback was complete ‚Äì but we couldn't claim all three points on the day.
