                            <br/>
                            A strong response was expected from the Gunners after a disappointing result against Villareal which saw us drop out of Europe.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Three fine goals from Emile Smith Rowe, Nicolas Pepe and Willian saw us claim a 3-1 victory against West Bromwich Albion on Sunday.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> 
                            Two excellent goals from Emile Smith Rowe who scored his first ever Premier League goal and Nicolas Pepe saw us leading 2-0 at the break.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>                         
                            The Baggies pulled one back when Pereira raced at the heart of our defence and fired a low shot beyond Bernd Leno and into the far corner but a 90th minute free kick from Willian saw 
                            us claim a comfortable win over the visitors. This was Willian's first goal for the Gunners.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>   
                            We sit 9th in the table with 52 points and 6 points away from 5th place West Ham. The gunners will hope that other results to go their way in order to have a chance at 
                            qualifying for Europe next season.
