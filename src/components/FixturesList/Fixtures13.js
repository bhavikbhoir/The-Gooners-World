                            Having scored his first ever League goal last weekend against the Baggies, Emile Smith Rowe scored his second league goal after capitalizing
                             on a Chelsea mistake to score the only goal of the game, and extend our winning run in the league to three games.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            This goal owed a bit more to good fortune though, as he stroked home from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's pass, once Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga had scrambled back to prevent an own goal.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> 
                            We displayed a strong defense for the rest of the game after scoring the early goal.

                            After a hard fought game, we managed to secure our first double over the London rivals since 20003/2004, with our first victory at Stamford Bridge since that famous 5-3 in 2011.
