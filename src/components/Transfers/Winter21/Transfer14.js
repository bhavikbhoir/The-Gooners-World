                            It looks like Mesut Ã–zil's Arsenal career is going to meet a sad ending!
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            As per initial reports, Mesut was in negotiations with MLS team DC United before finalzing on his move to the Turkish club Fenerbahce.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Rumours suggest that it will be a 6 month loan deal with a free summer transfer to be finalized later.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Since Mikel is adamant at brining back Ã–zil into the team as per the latest press conference ahead of the FA Cup tie, this move seems to be the best option for both parties.
