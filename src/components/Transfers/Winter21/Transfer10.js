                            The Bosnia & Herzegovina international will be returning to the club he joined as a youth player and spent five years in their first team before signing for us in June 2017.

                            Technical director Edu said: ‚ÄúSead needs to be playing regularly, so we have decided together that a move back to Germany with Schalke will benefit him at this moment. We will be keeping in close contact with Sead, and wish him huge success for the remainder of the season with Schalke.‚Äù
