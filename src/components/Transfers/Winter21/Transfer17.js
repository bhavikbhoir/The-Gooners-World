                            Mesut Ozil has joined Turkish Super Lig side Fenerbahce in a permanent transfer.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Mesut became our record signing when he joined us at the end of the 2013 transfer window from Real Madrid.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            He was soon to make an impact, claiming his first assist on his debut and ended his first season with the dramatic FA Cup final win over Hull City.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Two more FA Cups followed in the next three seasons and Mesut was also named Arsenal Player of the Season in 2015/16.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We wish Mesut the best in Turkey!
