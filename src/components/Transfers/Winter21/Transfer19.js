                            The 32-year-old made his first appearance since the FA Cup final win over Chelsea last June in the EFL Trophy in December, and played a couple of games for Arsenal under 23s towards the end of last year.

                            He leaves with 69 appearances under his belt and an FA Cup winner's medal.
