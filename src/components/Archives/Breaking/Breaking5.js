                            The Gooners World family has voted Bukayo Saka as the Arsenal player of the season 2020/21.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            After having a breakthrough season last year and winning the FA Cup, the 19 year old English International produced yet another brilliant season.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            It didn't take long for Saka to make a mark this season as he registered an assist in the 2020 FA Community Shield, which Arsenal clinched a 5â€“4 victory over Liverpool in the penalty shootout after the match was 1â€“1 after 90 minutes.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Due to his stellar performances, Saka was voted as the Player of the Month on Arsenal official website for three consecutive months (December - February).
                            On 6 March 2021, Saka made his 50th Premier League appearance for Arsenal in a 1â€“1 draw against Burnley; he's the second youngest player in club history to reach that milestone.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Saka also earned his first England senior team call when he debuted in a 3-0 victory over Wales on 4 Sepetember 2020.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Overall, Bukayo started 41 games this season with 4 substitute appearances and scored 7 goals with 7 assists for the Gunners.
