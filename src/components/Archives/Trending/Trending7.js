                            We'll open the campaign with a trip across London to take on top-flight new boys Brentford, before hosting Chelsea at Emirates Stadium and then hitting the road to go to the champions, Manchester City.

                            Our first north London derby of the season comes on September 25 as we host Tottenham, with the reverse fixture taking place on January 15.
