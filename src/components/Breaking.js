                            Norwegian international Martin Odegaard is joining us from Real Madrid on loan for the remainder of the season.

                            <br/>
                            Mikel Arteta said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great that we‚Äôve secured Martin to come to us until the end of the season. Martin is of course a player that we all know very well and although still young, he has been playing at the top level for a while. Martin will provide us with quality offensive options and we‚Äôre all excited to be integrating him into our plans between now and May.‚Äù

                            <br/>
                            Martin will wear the number 11 shirt.
