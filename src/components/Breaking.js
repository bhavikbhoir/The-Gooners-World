                            Goalkeeper Alex Runarsson has joined us on a four-year contract from French club Dijon.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The 25-year-old Iceland international joined the Ligue 1 club in July 2018 and made 13 appearances for them in all competitions last season.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Alex on why he signed for Arsenal - "It's one of the biggest clubs in the world... it's a win-win situation."
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Alex will wear the number 13 shirt at Arsenal.

                            The new shirt colours are intended to represent the lights and atmosphere that illuminate Emirates Stadium during a night match. The shirt pattern was created from a custom set of tie dye prints. */}
