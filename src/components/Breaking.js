                            Nuno Tavares has joined us from Benfica on a long-term contract.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The 21-year-old defender developed through the Benfica youth system, making his Benfica B debut in October 2018, before progressing into the first team squad. He made his first-team debut in the Portuguese Super Cup win over Sporting Lisbon in August 2019.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            The young defender will join up with his new team-mates in the coming days after he has travelled from Portugal and completed the current isolation regulations for international arrivals into the UK. Nuno will wear the number 20 shirt.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We welcome Nuno to The Arsenal and wish him the best.
